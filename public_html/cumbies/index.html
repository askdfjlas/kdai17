				<td style = "text-align: left">Once again, I had a hotdog; Peter had one as well. Who cares what Ethan got because he's still a loser. Definitely our most intellectual run as we had many a discussion regarding the constant possibility of getting randomly sniped (and dying). This was a surprisingly fast run, partially due to Andrew Phennicie and Joey Kim picking us up near town and dropping us off. Peter also walked surprisingly fast, despite his numerous crippling leg injuries. In addition to this, we did not have impediments to our travel such as the legend Abdul Haseeeb who is a god at Chemistry I unit conversions – the most daunting of intellectual tasks.</td>

				<td id="people">Ethan Hall, Howie Qu, and myself</td>
				<td style = "text-align: left">Our slowest cumbies run so far; we took a break on the way back, and did not have fortuitous circumstances such as having the motivation to run down Fox Run at Mach 10, or a driver to pick us up. Despite our lack of speed, it was still an enjoyable run that was filled with Soundcloud rap. Howie got a milkshake and I got a smoothie. I actually remember what Ethan got this time but still won't specify it because he's a loser. We wanted Peter Xu to come along with us, but unfortunately he had other activities to attend to that night. However, there was one person who we purposely excluded from this run: the legend Abdul Haseeeeb who got a 10/10 on his most recent (as of writing this) Chemistry I quiz. Despite his clear intellectual prowess, we were forced to omit him as he would have only been an impediment to our travel.</td>

				<td id="people">Ethan Hall, Peter Xu, and myself</td>
				<td style = "text-align: left">A very slow run, due to grabbing a pizza and chilling for a bit. Asides from the pizza, I don't really remember what people got (including Ethan because he's a loser LOL). I'm pretty sure I got some apple crisp thing which tasted kind of nice. Overall, this run was not particularly memorable, but it held importance nonetheless, being the day before our first Fall break. However, it is very notable that the legend
				Abdul Haseeeeeb was not purposely omitted from this run – he and Howie Qu were destined to embark on the perilous journey of taking the SAT. Despite this factor, we were not too somber, as Abdul Haseeeeeeb would have only been an impediment to our travel.</td>
